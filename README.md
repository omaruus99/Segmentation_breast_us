# Projet de Segmentation Tumorale - breast-us

## Introduction
Welcome to the personal Tumor Segmentation project developed as part of the MCOVISION training/certification program. This project focuses on the application of deep learning using the U-Net architecture for the precise segmentation of tumors in medical images.
## Objectives
-  **Accurate Tumor Segmentation:** Use deep learning models to accurately identify and segment tumors.
-  **Deployment of the model:** Implementation of a locally deployed Flask App API.
-  **Intuitive visualization:** Provide an interface for easy visualization of segmentation results.
